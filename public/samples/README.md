# Sample PDF Files for Resume Inspection

This directory should contain three sample PDF files for students to reference:

1. **sample-1-resume-structure.pdf** - Example of a well-structured resume
2. **sample-2-poster-layout.pdf** - Example of a good poster layout for Product Design projects
3. **sample-3-achievement-contribution.pdf** - Example showing strong achievement and contribution descriptions

## Instructions

1. Place the sample PDF files in this directory
2. Ensure file names match exactly:
   - `sample-1-resume-structure.pdf`
   - `sample-2-poster-layout.pdf`
   - `sample-3-achievement-contribution.pdf`
3. Files should be accessible via the route: `/student/resume-inspection/sample/{1|2|3}`

## Note

If sample files are not present, students will see a message directing them to contact the coordinator for reference samples.
